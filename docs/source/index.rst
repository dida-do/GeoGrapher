**GeoGrapher** is a Python library for building and handling remote sensing
computer vision datasets assembled from vector features and rasters.
It connects the features and rasters by a bipartite graph that keeps
track of the containment and intersection relations between them making it
particularly suited for *object-centric* vision tasks. GeoGrapher also
provides highly general and customizable dataset cutting functionality
as well as other utility functions.
