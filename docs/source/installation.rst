Installation
############

The GeoGrapher package has two external dependencies:

- Python 3.X or newer [where X is to be determined, possibly X=7]
- GDAL development files.  On most Linux distros, these are provided by
  the `gdal-devel` or `libgdal-dev` packages.

The package itself (and its Python dependencies) can be installed with::

  pip install GeoGrapher


To install the package for development work, clone this repo and run::

  make [TODO]
