Installation
############

The GeoGrapher package has two external dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- GDAL development files.  On most Linux distros, these are provided by
  the `gdal-devel` or `libgdal-dev` packages.

The package itself (and its Python dependencies) can be installed with::

  pip install GeoGrapher

To install the package for development work, clone this repo and run::

  make -B venv
